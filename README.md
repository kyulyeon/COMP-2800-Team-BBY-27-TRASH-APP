## <span id="01">Introduction</span>

The fight against climate change starts in your home! Even something as simple as properly sorting your trash can go a long way. Donâ€™t know how? No need to worry. TrashApp will help you understand the ins and outs of proper waste disposal.

Our app was inspired by the ever increasing importance of slowing down climate change. Improper waste disposal can lead to soil, water and air pollution. Not only does this contribute to the production of greenhouse gasses, it can also cause significant harm to marine and wildlife.
